                <p><b><big>T</big></b>he Dutch forward was heavily linked with a move to Barcelona prior to the 2020-21 season, speculation that mounted as <i>Los Cules</i> are coached by his ex-Netherlands boss <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman"target="_blank">Ronald Koeman</a></b>.</p>

                <p>With Depay out of contract at the end of June, rumours continue to circle that Barca may reignite their interest in the former <a href="https://www.manutd.com/" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> man. Depay has been influential for Lyon this season, contributing <b>15 goals</b> and <b>9 assists</b> from <b>30 appearances</b>in all competitions. He has a big-chance conversion rate of <big><b>61.11%</b></big>, while he has created <b>77</b> chances for team-mates - 16 of which are <i>Opta-defined</i> big chances. Lyon sit third in Ligue 1, level on <b>60 points</b> with <b><a href="https://www.psg.fr/"target="_blank">PSG</a></b> and three adrift of leaders <big><b>Lille</big></b>. Aulas hopes that domestic success may convince Depay to reject overtures from elsewhere.</p>

                <p><i>"For Memphis, I dream that he accepts our proposal, which is still relevant,"</i> he told AFP. <i>"He brings so much, he has been directly involved in 23 league goals this season. The offer will stay there and, if we are champions, why not?"</i></p>

                <p><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Laporta">Joan Laporta</a></span> will hold his first board meeting on Friday after being sworn in as president of Barcelona this week. Laporta's board will gather at 14:00 CET at the Camp Nou and, given the club's current financial plight, they will focus their attention on the economic situation.</p>

                <p>After the departure of Luis Suárez. Koeman asked for Depay. The two have worked together for the Netherlands national team before, which inspired confidence in the manager. However, a deal with Lyon was never agreed. Now, he’s looking to sign Depay and one other center-forward. Barcelona and Memphis Depay, a tale as old as the second Ronald Koeman was hired as manager. Surely, this summer will bring the end to all the speculation and wonder surrounding his future, right?

                   Well, not if Lyon has anything to say about it. Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas spoke about the possibility of Depay signing a new deal with Lyon amidst all the Barca chatter.</p>

                <p>Until the end we believe that he will renew for next season. Right now it is not something that is possible but why not? He is a great talent, world class. There are not many like him in the team.

                   He brings solutions. I always wanted him to remain but our offers did not convince him. We helped him go to FC Barcelona but financially it was not possible.”</p>
